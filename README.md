This project is a simple calculator app that I built to showcase my skills in React JS, Sass, and BEM. The app is responsive and can adapt to any screen size, making it easy to use on any device.

## Skills Learned

- React JS hooks: I learned how to use React hooks, such as `useReducer`, to manage state in my React components. This made it easier to write clean and maintainable code.
- Sass: I used Sass as a replacement for CSS to make styling my app faster and easier. Sass allows me to use features like variables and mixins, which can help to reduce repetition and make my stylesheets more modular.
- BEM: I also learned how to use the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology to write modular and reusable styles in Sass. This helps to prevent naming conflicts and make my styles easier to understand.

## Technologies Used

- React: I used the React framework to build the user interface for my app. React makes it easy to create reusable components and manage state in my app.
- Sass: I used Sass to write the styles for my app. Sass allows me to use advanced features like variables and mixins to make my stylesheets more modular and maintainable.
- Netlify: I used Netlify to host my app. Netlify makes it easy to deploy my app and provides a free SSL certificate for secure browsing.
- Vite: I used Vite as my frontend tooling. Vite is a fast and lightweight tool that allows me to develop my app with hot module replacement, which speeds up the development process.
